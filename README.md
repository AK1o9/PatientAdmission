# PatientAdmission
- This system is intended for *nurses & doctors* to manage and sort patients' positions in a waiting list (or queue), visit history and perform various administrative tasks. 
- The system also makes use of ***singly linked lists*** as data structures for managing patient records, so it basically makes use of nodes and node addresses, which are used inorder to link each node to the next.
- It is advisable to run this using a command prompt ('cmd' for instance) as the system has custom colors and properties.
